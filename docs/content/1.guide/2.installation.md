  ```

  ```bash [Check Dependencies]
  wails doctor
  ```

  rpm-ostree install webkit2gtk4.0-devel gtk3-devel
  # Requires reboot on atomic systems
  ```

  ```bash [Ubuntu / Debian]
  sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libgtk-3-dev
  ```

  ```powershell [Windows]
  # WebView2 is pre-installed on Windows 10/11
  # No action needed
  ```

## Build the Hub

::steps
### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lobinuxsoft/capydeploy
cd capydeploy
```

### Initialize submodules

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Build

::code-group
  ```bash [Linux / macOS]
  cd apps/hub
  ./build.sh
  ```

  ```powershell [Windows]
  cd apps\hub
  .\build.bat
  ```
::

### Run
The executable is in `build/bin/`. Double-click or run from terminal.
::

::alert{type="success"}
**Tip:** The Hub is where you manage your game library. Run this on your main PC.
::

## Build the Agent

::steps
### Navigate to agent folder

```bash
cd apps/agent
```

### Build

::code-group
  ```bash [Linux / macOS]
  ./build.sh
  ```

  ```powershell [Windows]
  .\build.bat
  ```
::

### Copy to handheld
Transfer the executable to your device via USB, SSH, or any method you prefer.

### Run
The Agent starts in the system tray and begins advertising via mDNS.
::

::alert{type="warning"}
**Cross-compilation:** To build for a different platform:
```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 wails build
```
::

## First Run

::steps
### Start Agent on handheld
```bash
./capyagent
```
Look for the system tray icon.

### Start Hub on PC
```bash
./capyhub
```
The Hub will discover Agents automatically.

### Pair the devices
- Click on an Agent in the Hub
- A 6-digit code appears on the Agent
- Enter the code in the Hub
- Done! Token stored for future connections.
::

## Troubleshooting

::alert{type="danger" title="Agent not discovered?"}
- Ensure both devices are on the same network
- Check if mDNS is blocked by firewall
- On Linux: `systemctl status avahi-daemon`
::

::alert{type="danger" title="Connection refused?"}
- Check if port 9999 is open
- Agent might have "Accept Connections" disabled
- Check firewall rules on both devices
::

::alert{type="danger" title="Steam shortcuts not appearing?"}
- Make sure Steam is running on the Agent
- Check if the correct Steam user is logged in
- Agent restarts Steam automatically after creating shortcuts
