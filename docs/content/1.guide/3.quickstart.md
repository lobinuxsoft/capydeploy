# Quick Start

Let's deploy your first game. This assumes you've already [installed](/guide/installation) both Hub and Agent.

## Deploy a Game

::steps
### Start the Agent
Run `./capyagent` on your handheld. It appears in the system tray.

### Start the Hub
Run `./capyhub` on your PC. Your handheld should appear in the list.

### Pair (first time only)
Click on the Agent. Enter the 6-digit code shown on the handheld.

### Add a game
Click **Add Game** or drag a game folder into the Hub.

### Configure
- Select the executable
- (Optional) Search for artwork on SteamGridDB

### Deploy!
Click **Deploy**. Watch the progress bar.

### Play
The game appears in Steam on your handheld. If not, restart Steam.

## What Happens During Deploy

::list{type="primary"}
- Files are chunked into 1MB pieces
- Each chunk is sent via WebSocket
- Agent writes files to disk
- Steam shortcut is created
- Artwork is downloaded and applied
- Steam is restarted to show the new game
::

## Tips

::alert{type="success" title="Artwork"}
Use [SteamGridDB](https://www.steamgriddb.com/) to find high-quality artwork. The Hub has built-in search integration.
::

::alert{type="info" title="Large Games"}
Games transfer in 1MB chunks. If the connection drops, you can resume where you left off.
::

::alert{type="warning" title="Steam Restart"}
Steam needs to restart to show new shortcuts. The Agent handles this automatically, but your current game might be interrupted.
