# Introduction

CapyDeploy is a tool for **deploying games to handheld devices** running Steam (Steam Deck, Bazzite, or any Linux/Windows PC).

::alert{type="info"}
**Built for:** Game developers testing builds, retro gaming enthusiasts, anyone tired of manual file transfers.
::

## The Problem

You have games on your PC. You want them on your handheld. The usual workflow:

::list{type="danger"}
- Find game files manually
- Copy via SSH/USB/network share
- Create Steam shortcut by hand
- Hunt for artwork on SteamGridDB
- Apply artwork one image at a time
- Repeat every time you update a build
::

**Tedious.** Especially when iterating on game builds.

## The Solution

CapyDeploy automates everything:

::list{type="success"}
- Hub discovers Agents via mDNS automatically
- WebSocket connection for real-time communication
- Select folder → Click Deploy
- Binary chunks stream over WebSocket
- Shortcut created with artwork applied
- Progress events in real-time
::

::alert{type="success"}
**Result:** What took 10+ minutes now happens while you watch.
::

## Architecture

CapyDeploy uses a **Hub-Agent** pattern with **WebSocket** as the primary communication channel:

::card-grid
  ::card{icon=ph:desktop-duotone}
  #title
  Hub (Your PC)
  #description
  Control center. Discovers Agents via mDNS. Opens WebSocket connection. Sends games as binary chunks.
  ::

  ::card{icon=ph:device-mobile-duotone}
  #title
  Agent (Handheld)
  #description
  Runs on target device. WebSocket server on port 9999. Receives chunks, creates shortcuts, applies artwork.
  ::
::

**Communication:** `ws://[agent]:9999/ws` - persistent WebSocket connection

## Key Features

### mDNS Discovery
Agents broadcast `_capydeploy._tcp.local` on port 9999. Hub listens and discovers automatically.

### WebSocket Protocol
All communication happens over WebSocket:
- Handshake and pairing
- RPC-style requests/responses
- Binary chunk uploads
- Real-time progress events

### Secure Pairing
First connection: Agent shows 6-digit code (valid 60 seconds). Enter in Hub. Token stored for future use.

### Binary Uploads
Games split into 1MB binary chunks sent over WebSocket. Resume support if connection drops.

### Steam Integration
Agents with Steam can:
- Create non-Steam game shortcuts
- Apply artwork (grid, hero, logo, icon, banner)
- Restart Steam to show changes

### Capabilities System
Agents report what they support. Hub adapts UI. Android (future) = file upload only, no Steam.
